# SVG-Maker
My motivation for this challenge was to produce something that the user interacted with to receive an immediate result for a logo. This challenge helped me to gain a better understanding of object oriented programming, jest, node, and inquirer. This does solve a very common problem for a new business in need of a logo for their startup. I utilized help from a TA and fellow students along with reviewing the class recordings to assist with understanding this challenge more.
